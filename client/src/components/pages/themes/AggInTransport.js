    1. Driving Growth through Our AGG in the Transport Sector
    
    Our commitment to the Agenda for Growth (AGG) in the transport sector is a testament to our dedication to fostering positive change and development. The AGG serves as our guiding blueprint for shaping the future of the transport industry in Kenya and beyond. We believe that growth is not merely an outcome; it’s a deliberate endeavor that necessitates comprehensive planning and action. Our AGG revolves around key principles such as infrastructure enhancement, policy reforms, capacity building, and sustainable practices. It aligns with our mission of developing the capacity and safety of the transport sector. By actively engaging with local governments, community organizations, and industry partners, we work collaboratively to implement the AGG, which seeks to make transportation safer, more efficient, and environmentally sustainable. Through our unwavering commitment to the AGG, we are driving growth that benefits not only our company but the entire transportation ecosystem.
