      <h3> Empowering Through Capacity Building</h3>

Capacity building is at the heart of our mission at TSID-NET. We understand that to drive sustainable change and enhance the safety and development of the transport sector, we must empower individuals and organizations with the knowledge and skills they need. Our commitment to capacity building is evident in the array of initiatives we undertake. We support organizations and institutions by enhancing their ability to deliver essential road safety reforms. This support encompasses data collection and analysis, research, institutional strengthening, and training programs aimed at equipping them with the necessary expertise. Our annual and biennial national/regional road transport and safety technical seminars, training sessions, and conferences are designed to provide a platform for skill development and knowledge sharing. Our primary goal is to ensure that we strengthen the capacity of all stakeholders involved, from governments to NGOs, enabling them to contribute to a safer and more sustainable transport system.

 <h3>Building a Resilient Transport Ecosystem</h3>

In our pursuit of building a safer and more resilient transport ecosystem, capacity building plays a pivotal role. We firmly believe that empowered individuals and organizations are better equipped to address the evolving challenges within the transport sector. Whether itâ€™s working with local governments, community groups, or industry partners, we are committed to sharing expertise and knowledge that fosters better decision-making, safer practices, and effective policy implementation. Through a combination of training, workshops, and resources, we aim to develop the leadership capacity of those involved in road safety and transport development. As a result, we are contributing to the creation of a sustainable, well-informed, and skilled transport community that can adapt to changes, drive innovation, and ultimately make the roads safer for everyone. Capacity building is a cornerstone of our approach to achieving our vision of becoming a leading organization in the exchange of knowledge on safe and sustainable road transport and safety policy and practice.
